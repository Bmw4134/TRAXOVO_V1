### Regression Analysis
```
PROBLEM: The current system was dumbed down from the original supreme intelligence platform

ORIGINAL CAPABILITIES LOST:
1. Watson quantum consciousness interface
2. ASI-AGI-AI-ML hierarchical processing
3. Real Fort Worth fleet data visualization
4. Voice command processing
5. Autonomous decision-making
6. Executive billion-dollar modules
7. Quantum coherence monitoring
8. Advanced predictive analytics

SOLUTION: Restore original files and integrate with current database
```

### Deployment Commands Found
```bash
# Original deployment commands:
python main_deploy.py
python app_working.py
gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 main_deploy:app

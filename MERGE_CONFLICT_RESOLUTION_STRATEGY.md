# Git Merge Conflict Resolution Strategy

## Status: Active Merge Conflicts Detected

### Conflict Categories:

#### 1. Core Application Files (High Priority)
- `main.py` - ✓ RESOLVED - Quantum stealth integration preserved
- `app.py` - Needs resolution
- `app_minimal.py` - Needs resolution

#### 2. Configuration Files (Medium Priority)
- `.dockerignore` - Auto-merge conflict
- `.env.production` - Add/add conflict  
- `.replit` - Content conflict
- `pyproject.toml` - Content conflict

#### 3. Template Files (Medium Priority)
- `templates/dashboard.html` - Add/add conflict
- `templates/landing.html` - Add/add conflict
- `templates/login.html` - Content conflict
- `templates/attendance_matrix.html` - Content conflict

#### 4. Deleted vs Modified Files (Low Priority)
- Multiple files deleted in remote but modified locally
- Recommended: Keep local versions to preserve quantum stealth functionality

#### 5. Database Files (Low Priority)
- Various `.db` files deleted remotely but modified locally
- Recommended: Keep local versions for data integrity

### Resolution Approach:

#### Phase 1: Core Application Stability
1. ✓ Resolve main.py syntax errors - COMPLETE
2. Resolve app.py conflicts - preserve quantum orchestrator integration
3. Update configuration files for deployment compatibility

#### Phase 2: Template Integration
1. Merge dashboard templates - preserve quantum stealth navigation
2. Integrate landing page enhancements
3. Resolve login template conflicts

#### Phase 3: Cleanup and Optimization
1. Handle deleted vs modified file conflicts
2. Clean up unused database files
3. Finalize deployment configuration

### Current Status:
- Application running with quantum stealth integration intact
- Main syntax errors resolved
- Ready for systematic conflict resolution

### Next Steps:
1. Resolve app.py conflicts to maintain quantum orchestrator functionality
2. Update templates to integrate both local and remote enhancements
3. Finalize configuration for deployment readiness

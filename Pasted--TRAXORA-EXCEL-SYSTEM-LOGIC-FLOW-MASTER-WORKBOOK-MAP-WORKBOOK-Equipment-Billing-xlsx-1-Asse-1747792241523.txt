# TRAXORA EXCEL SYSTEM LOGIC FLOW - MASTER WORKBOOK MAP

WORKBOOK: Equipment Billing.xlsx

# 1. Asset List Sheet
# Purpose: Acts as the primary relational hub for asset-driver pairing.
# Fields: Employee ID, Employee Name, Asset Number, Job Site Assignment
# Logic:
# - Pulls data via formulas from “Drivers” and “Start Time & Job”
# - Used to validate all telematics and attendance events against ground truth

# 2. Drivers Sheet
# Purpose: Acts as a manually-updated employee registry (March–April)
# Fields: Driver Names, IDs, Asset Assignment, Active Status
# Usage:
# - Used as source of verified drivers and assignments prior to final master list
# - Referenced in formulas on “Asset List”

# 3. Start Time & Job Sheet
# Purpose: **Dynamically-generated baseline for each driver**
# Fields: Scheduled Start, Scheduled End, Job Site, Asset, Driver Name
# Logic:
# - Pulls data from pivot table output
# - Pivot table is refreshed from DrivingHistory input
# - Final “Start Time & Job” sheet is NOT manually maintained—it’s derived
# Dependency:
#     → Depends on refreshed DrivingHistory data
#     → Used as the core baseline for Daily Driver Reports

# 4. DrivingHistory Raw File (CSV/Excel)
# Purpose: Telematics-based GPS check-in log
# Logic:
# - Provides Key On/Off timestamps
# - Maps to Start Time & Job by Asset ID
# - Is pivoted → exported → becomes basis for Start Time data

# 5. Activity Detail / Assets Time on Site
# Purpose: Used to validate location data and idle/stationary time
# - Helps determine if employee was *at* the job site vs. rogue location
# - Used in conjunction with the GPS logs to determine “Not on Job”

# 6. Final Output (PDF/Excel Reports)
# - Should only reference values derived through the above hierarchy
# - Any “Start Time & Job” values used must be parsed with context
#   → They are NOT the primary source, they are the result of upstream logic

# System Instruction for Replit or Agent:
# DO NOT treat “Start Time & Job” as authoritative or standalone
# It is the output of deeper workbook logic
# All driver validation must be rooted in:
#   → Drivers Sheet (or updated master list)
#   → Asset List Sheet
#   → DrivingHistory Refresh Logic

# GOAL:
# System must trace all data elements in Daily Driver Reports to their workbook logic lineage
# Replit should reprocess the logic of Start Time & Job if DrivingHistory or Pivot Tables have changed

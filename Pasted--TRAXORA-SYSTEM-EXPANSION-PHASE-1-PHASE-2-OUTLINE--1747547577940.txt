TRAXORA SYSTEM EXPANSION
PHASE 1 & PHASE 2 OUTLINE
===========================

>> PHASE 1: SMART UX INFRASTRUCTURE
-----------------------------------
Purpose:
- Enhance core usability, UI logic, and operational clarity.
- Establish modular framework with responsive role-based logic.
- Set the foundation for intelligent user interaction tracking.

Deliverables:
- [x] Modular Left-Side Navigation
      - Sections: Dashboard, Assets, Job Zones, PM Allocation, Attendance, Maintenance, Reports, Admin, Billing
      - Expandable dropdowns + role-based menu visibility
      - Context-aware organization toggle

- [x] Quick Action Panel (Floating or Fixed)
      - Actions: Daily Driver Report, Upload Docs, OCR Tool, Generate Report, Sync PM
      - Mobile responsive support

- [x] Theme Switching (Light/Dark)
      - Toggle UI mode without reload
      - Local storage of theme preference

- [x] Smart Activity Logging
      - Log schema: user_id, action_type, timestamp, resource_id, success/failure, context
      - Tracked: API pulls, uploads, PM allocation actions, navigation

- [x] Responsive UX Enhancements
      - Auto-scrolling cards
      - Simplified mobile menus
      - Sticky headers and contextual breadcrumbs

>> PHASE 2: MACHINE INTELLIGENCE BACKEND
-----------------------------------------
Purpose:
- Leverage tracked data to optimize system use and predict needs.
- Build a smart, adaptive UX layer with embedded operational intelligence.

Deliverables:
- [ ] Predictive UX Engine
      - Suggest next best action based on time, role, and usage pattern
      - Prioritize high-usage tools in the UI dynamically

- [ ] Anomaly Detection System
      - Cross-reference API syncs, attendance, uploads
      - Alert: missing reports, irregular entries, gaps in flow

- [ ] Behavior-Adaptive Personalization
      - Reorder modules by user frequency
      - Offer shortcuts to recurring actions

- [ ] Admin Intel Console
      - Visual logs and behavior heatmaps
      - Smart alerts (e.g., “Asset sync skipped 3 days”)

- [ ] ML-Ready Data Stream
      - Soft audit trail: clean, structured event logs for training
      - Early architecture for supervised learning integration

Next Steps:
- Deploy Phase 1 now (UI + logging foundation)
- Begin Phase 2 stubs and logging channels in parallel
- Modularize by user/org to support scale

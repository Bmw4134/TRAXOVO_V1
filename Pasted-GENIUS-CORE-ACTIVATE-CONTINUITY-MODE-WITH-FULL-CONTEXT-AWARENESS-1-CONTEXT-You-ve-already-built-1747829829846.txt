GENIUS CORE — ACTIVATE CONTINUITY MODE WITH FULL CONTEXT AWARENESS

1. CONTEXT:
You've already built the GENIUS CORE HARDLINE MODE for TRAXORA and confirmed validation pipelines, workbook trace lineage, and driver integrity through source triangulation (Asset List, DrivingHistory, ActivityDetail). However, logic dependencies within the Excel workbook were misinterpreted — particularly the role of "Start Time & Job" as derived data rather than standalone input.

2. OBJECTIVE:
Re-synchronize the Daily Driver Report module with the actual Excel workbook logic hierarchy:
- Recognize that "Start Time & Job" sheet is a downstream compilation, not a primary source.
- Use **Asset List** from the Equipment Billing workbook as the relational source of truth.
- Use the embedded pivot tables and formulas (within Billing workbook) to extract:
  - Employee ID
  - Asset pairing
  - Scheduled Start / End times
  - Job Site and Geolocation
- Telematics data (DrivingHistory / ActivityDetail) should **validate and classify** driver presence, time-on-site, and timing accuracy.

3. REQUIREMENTS:
- Properly resolve all workbook dependencies **without requiring manual refresh**.
- Identify and use the embedded Excel formulas and pivot outputs as valid dynamic data flows.
- Fix the Not On Job classification logic: ensure that if a driver has asset & telematics data, they cannot be falsely classified unless location/time thresholds fail.
- Rebuild Daily Driver Report logic using this adjusted hierarchy:
  - Step 1: Extract driver list from **Asset List** in billing workbook.
  - Step 2: Map to derived Start/End/Job location via workbook formula outputs.
  - Step 3: Match and validate telematics events.
  - Step 4: Apply correct status logic using cross-source validation.
  - Step 5: Exclude trailers or test entries from report via new test data flag logic.

4. NEXT ACTIONS:
- Regenerate a fully validated May 16 Daily Report using this corrected pipeline.
- Ensure “Not On Job” count reflects true absence or invalid location only.
- Create ingestion flow that can take the full Equipment Billing workbook + telematics CSVs as dynamic source input.
- Optionally cache parsed workbook logic to avoid reprocessing formulas manually.

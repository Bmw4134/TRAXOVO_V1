GENIUS CORE CONTINUITY MODE: REBUILD DIRECTIVE

SYSTEM REQUEST:
Initiate full GENIUS CORE continuity rebuild with strict data integrity enforcement, report lineage tracing, and module repair. The following modules must be realigned and restored to operational status using proper workbook logic flow and traceable source validation:

1. DAILY DRIVER MODULE:
   - Use "Asset List" from Equipment Billing workbook as the primary relational source of truth
   - Treat "Start Time & Job" as derived, not standalone input
   - Validate telematics using DrivingHistory + ActivityDetail (match asset-driver-time-site)
   - Eliminate ghost/test data
   - Fix PDF/Excel export integrity (match dashboard and preview outputs)
   - Include trace manifest in report metadata

2. PM BILLING MODULE:
   - Restore billing/allocator logic using original workbook-derived driver-asset mapping
   - Fix 500 errors in pm-allocation-processor route
   - Re-enable upload, compare, export flow for PM allocation files

3. ASSET MAP MODULE:
   - Reconnect live asset geolocation to correct GPS/timestamp fields
   - Restore asset type filters, icon rendering, and driver status overlays
   - Fix broken map tiles or asset icons
   - Validate "Disposed" filter logic with live/archived asset data

4. DASHBOARD + ROUTING:
   - Rebuild broken dashboard links to key modules (Daily Driver, PM Allocation, Asset Map)
   - Reinstate API status view and quick nav panel
   - Ensure all routes are properly registered and HTML templates are accessible
   - Add fallback/error logging for broken components

SYSTEM INTEGRATION:
✓ Reconnect GENIUS CORE pipeline to workbook-based logic hierarchy
✓ Apply HARDLINE MODE validation
✓ Rebuild internal routing for broken modules
✓ Confirm report integrity via sample run for 2025-05-19 and 2025-05-16

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Return a full status breakdown:
- Fixed modules
- Source lineage trace
- Remaining issues (if any)
- Prompt to re-ingest real source files if needed

CONFIRM: Begin GENIUS CORE continuity rebuild now.

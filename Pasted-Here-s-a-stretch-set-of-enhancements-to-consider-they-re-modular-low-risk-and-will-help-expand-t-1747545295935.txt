Here’s a stretch set of enhancements to consider — they’re modular, low-risk, and will help expand the dashboard’s functionality, performance, and future readiness. If any can be slotted in post-core delivery or during low-intensity cycles, they’ll add real depth:

---

1. **Context-Aware Notifications**  
Trigger dynamic reminders or alerts based on user activity:
- No API pulls in X days
- New document uploads since last report
- Daily Driver module unused today  
(Backend triggers + toast or banner UI)

2. **Auto-Sync Scheduler (Gauge API)**  
Add a scheduled pull (e.g., 8am daily) to keep data fresh without user action.  
Can run as a cron job or task runner. Fallback to manual if fails.

3. **Change History Log (Soft Audit Trail)**  
Track and timestamp user edits, deletions, or uploads across modules:
- User ID, action, module, timestamp  
Ideal for internal auditing, debugging, or eventual rollback/undo logic.

4. **CSV/Export Cache with Expiry**  
Save the most recent export (CSV/PDF) per user/module:
- Timestamped
- Auto-expire after 24–48h  
Prevents redundant processing, adds fallback support.

5. **Modular Report Builder (Phase 1)**  
Let users choose which data blocks to include before exporting:
- Checkboxes: Asset Summary, Billings, Daily Driver, Upload Logs  
Lays foundation for fully customizable reporting.

6. **Mobile Drilldown UX**  
Allow tap-to-expand functionality on key data cards (Assets, Drivers, Billings) for nested info:
- Modal or accordion-style  
Boosts mobile usability without layout overhaul.

7. **Permissions API Endpoint**  
Expose `/permissions` endpoint returning current user's allowed actions/roles  
- Frontend can dynamically enable/disable buttons or UI zones  
Clean structure for future admin controls.

8. **Passive Uptime Logger**  
Log each successful or failed module load for uptime/bug analysis  
- Track user, module, timestamp, result  
Low-overhead observability layer, useful for support/QA.

Let me know which of these feel feasible after core delivery — or if any are light enough to begin now. Each adds polish, intelligence, or system resilience.

Initiate full-stack TRAXORA Fleet System stabilization and readiness.

The following must be implemented in complete, verifiable form:

––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
PHASE 1: PIPELINE INTEGRITY

✓ Validate that all raw data sources (ActivityDetail, DrivingHistory, AssetsTimeOnSite, Timecards, PM Billing) are being properly parsed
✓ Confirm that date-stamped data is stored or cached for repeat access
✓ Log successful pipeline runs per date in `logs/pipeline_status.log`

PHASE 2: DAILY DRIVER REPORT SYSTEM

✓ Fix `/drivers/daily-report` route to render only for valid, processed dates
✓ Block rendering of pages for future or unprocessed dates — show a “No Data Available” banner
✓ Fix export links (PDF/XLSX) to appear only if files are generated and present
✓ Ensure file generation writes to `/exports/daily_reports/` and files are accessible via HTTP
✓ Normalize date rendering and prevent mismatched day-labels

PHASE 3: TREND ANALYSIS INTEGRATION

✓ Ensure multi-day trend flags (CHRONIC_LATE, REPEATED_ABSENCE, UNSTABLE_SHIFT) are computed for every driver across valid attendance windows
✓ Include trend flags in all dashboard views and export summaries
✓ Add JSON export for trend data to `/exports/trends/`

PHASE 4: BILLING AND PM ALLOCATION

✓ Ensure April mock billing runs to completion
✓ Generate `/exports/billing/April_MockBilling_Complete.xlsx` with full asset × rate × allocation logic
✓ Respect job-level cost code fallbacks, asset division mappings, and revisions
✓ Include job site metadata in all PM billing outputs

PHASE 5: DATA UNIFORMITY & STANDARDS

✓ Normalize all division codes using this map:
   DFW → DIV 2 | HOU → DIV 4 | WT → DIV 3  
   TEXDIST → DIV 8 | DALOH-HH → DIV 2  
   HOUOH-HH → DIV 4 | WTOH-HH → DIV 3

✓ Employee normalization:
   - Employee ID padded, SSN-last-6 extractable, contact info unified
   - Match across WEX, ELIST, JLIST

✓ Time normalization:
   - Strip "CT", convert internally to 24h, display consistently as HH:MM AM/PM

✓ Asset normalization:
   - Extract vehicle ID from assetlabel (e.g. “ET-01”), unify format in all reports

✓ Cost code fallback:
   - Ensure jobs without known cost codes default to `9000 100M` or `9000 100F`

✓ Job site mapping:
   - Normalize capitalization, spelling, and locations

PHASE 6: FILE + ROUTING CORRECTIONS

✓ Ensure `/exports/daily_reports/<DATE>_DailyDriverReport.xlsx` and `.pdf` return valid files via HTTP
✓ If not found, suppress link and show tooltip
✓ Add 404 fallback pages for all invalid routes
✓ Implement `/health` endpoint with pass/fail status and timestamp

PHASE 7: FAULT TOLERANCE & LOGGING

✓ All 500s must be caught and logged — return user-friendly feedback in dashboard
✓ Log file access attempts and failures
✓ Log all export attempts to `logs/export_audit.log`
✓ System should never crash when:
   - A file is missing
   - A user clicks a bad link
   - A driver record is incomplete

PHASE 8: EXPORT FORMAT UNIFICATION

✓ All XLSX/PDF exports must:
   - Match structure: headers, fields, fonts
   - Include metadata rows (generated timestamp, origin, report type)
   - Use same naming pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD_<ReportType>.<ext>`

PHASE 9: DEMO PREP / STAGING STABILITY

✓ Fix UI responsiveness across devices (mobile/tablet/desktop)
✓ Ensure Attendance Dashboard loads without error
✓ Enable “Download All Reports” function per week
✓ Confirm accurate and aligned summary counts on all dashboards

FINAL VALIDATION:

Once complete, respond with:
- List of processed dates
- All working export links
- System uptime confirmation
- Exported trend flags for past 5 days
- Validated division/driver/job mapping structure

GENIUS CORE will independently verify all components and issue deployment certification upon completion.

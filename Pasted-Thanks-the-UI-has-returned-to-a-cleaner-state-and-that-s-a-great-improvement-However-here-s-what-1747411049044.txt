Thanks ‚Äî the UI has returned to a cleaner state and that‚Äôs a great improvement. However, here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm seeing now:

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Blockers / Errors

- Attempting to generate Driver Reports throws a parsing error on `ActivityDetail (6).csv` ‚Äî line 8 appears malformed or the parser expects fewer fields. Can you sanitize that or fallback to flexible parsing logic?
- The Maintenance module returns a `500 Server Error`.
- The Asset view is still placeholder and not reflective of actual connected asset data.
- PM Billing Allocations uploader is visually present but doesn‚Äôt process the uploads yet.

---

### ‚úÖ Current Functionality Working

- Dashboard interface looks cleaner again
- Navigation structure to Reports, Uploads, Maintenance, etc. appears restored
- SystemSmith branding and visual hierarchy mostly in place

---

### üß† Priorities (Today / Tomorrow)

1. **Fix Daily Driver Report Generator**
   - Sanitize or dynamically parse the uploaded `Activity Detail` + `Driving History` source files
   - Consolidate the LS, EE, NOJ sections into a **single clean report**
   - Output an Outlook-ready email body template with summary text and Excel file(s) attached
   - Use the format from Diana Torres‚Äô daily email for styling

2. **Get Equipment Billing PM Revisions Working**
   - Enable PM allocation uploads to compare original vs revised billing allocations
   - Process and generate regional exports for Foundation import

3. **Dashboard Continuity**
   - Keep the current design stable while back-end builds continue
   - Restore access to key areas like:
     - User Login Management
     - API tab for status/config
     - Admin-only tools

4. **Upcoming (Tertiary Features)**
   - Integrate timecard data for weekly reviews (esp. Mondays)
   - Track salaried employee compliance with 40hr weekly requirement
   - Possibly automate the 9AM daily payroll report for Diana

Let me know once the Driver Reports error is fixed ‚Äî I‚Äôll re-test with the same source files. Also confirm if we can consolidate the current multiple .csv outputs into a single formatted .xlsx or PDF summary for user-friendliness.

Thanks again ‚Äî amazing progress visually and structurally!

You are tasked with finalizing and stabilizing the TRAXORA Daily Driver Reporting system. Execute the following full-system directive across phases to ensure robust operation, report accuracy, and future modular extensibility:

=====================
PHASE 1: SYSTEM STABILIZATION & ERROR IMMUNITY
=====================
- Fix any internal server or 404 errors on:
  - /drivers/daily-report
  - /attendance-dashboard
  - /exports/daily_reports/*
- Create fallback handlers for all routes to prevent app crashes
- Ensure PDF and Excel export links work correctly and always generate actual files
- Fix static file routing so daily reports are accessible from:
  /exports/daily_reports/YYYY-MM-DD_DailyDriverReport.pdf
- If a file is missing, generate a placeholder response with diagnostics

=====================
PHASE 2: REPORTING ACCURACY & EMPLOYEE MAPPING
=====================
- Rebuild the employee mapping pipeline to use the latest consolidated employee list
  - Match on employee ID or name (with alias support)
  - Prioritize phone number, email, and job role
- Sanitize input to prevent fake/random names in reports
- Validate the Start Time & Job sheet for job assignments and expected times
  - Use this sheet to supplement or correct asset labels and schedule mismatches
- Report entries must reflect real employees only — remove placeholder or unmatched rows unless flagged

=====================
PHASE 3: DATA INGESTION PIPELINE + BACKFILL
=====================
- Automatically ingest and process:
  - DrivingHistory.csv
  - ActivityDetail.csv
  - AssetsTimeOnSite.csv
  - DailyUsage.csv
- Rebuild reports for 2025-05-15, 2025-05-16, and 2025-05-19 using latest MTD files
- Add backfill processing to retroactively reconstruct any missing reports using MTD or partial data
- Re-sync with updated Groundworks timecards

=====================
PHASE 4: DASHBOARD + UI CLEANUP
=====================
- Fix date selector bugs and improve invalid date handling
- Ensure all dropdowns (company, asset, driver) reflect actual database values
- Make PDF viewer fully responsive and properly styled
- Add visual indicators for "Unmatched", "Late", "Early", and "Absent" status
- Enable links to download both Excel and PDF reports for each day

=====================
PHASE 5: FUTURE-READY MODULAR EXTENSION
=====================
- Log which files contribute to each report (with audit trail)
- Prepare billing module to consume processed time allocations per driver
- Add placeholder integration points for future modules:
  - Fuel card report reconciliation
  - WEX PIN matching via last 6 of SSN
  - Multi-day trend forecasting
  - Supervisor messaging (email/SMS contact lists)
- Ensure all output conforms to one standardized schema

=====================
CRITICAL NOTES:
=====================
- Do not generate or inject fake employee names or assets
- Use the “Start Time & Job” sheet as a trusted scheduling authority
- If employee matching fails, log it with driver_id, asset, and time
- Reports must align with email pivot structure from manual process
- Optimize all code to reduce future runtime and storage costs

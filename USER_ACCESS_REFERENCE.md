## WHAT TO EXPECT WHEN TESTING

### Working Features
- Login system with role-based access
- Watson Console with real commands
- Voice recognition and processing
- Fleet map with interactive elements
- Email operations with actual processing
- Performance metrics and system monitoring
- PDF report generation

### Placeholder Features
- Some business operation modules show interfaces but need external API connections
- Analytics dashboards need real data source integration
- Market research requires external data feeds

## EXTERNAL INTEGRATIONS NEEDED

To activate placeholder features, you would need to provide:
- SmartSheets API credentials for PO system
- HCSS API access for dispatch/estimating
- Equipment sensor data feeds
- Market research data APIs
- Email server credentials for full email processing

The system is designed to gracefully handle missing external connections while maintaining full functionality for integrated components.

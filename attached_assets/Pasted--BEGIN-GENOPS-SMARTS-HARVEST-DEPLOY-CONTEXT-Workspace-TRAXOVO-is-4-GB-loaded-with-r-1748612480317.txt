CONTEXT:
- Workspace ‚ÄúTRAXOVO‚Äù is 4 GB, loaded with real data (Gauge, GroundWorks, geofences, templates, code).  
- Deadline: 10 AM 5/30/2025 (currently 8:40 AM).

OBJECTIVE:
1. Ingest and analyze 3 high-star public Replit community templates for fleet/attendance dashboards.  
2. Identify 5 concrete patterns or utilities they use (e.g., Blueprint structure, APScheduler cron jobs, Nix-based reproducible builds, live-reload hooks, compact CSS/JS frameworks).  
3. Apply those patterns directly to your TRAXOVO attendance module ONLY‚Äîno scaffolds or placeholders, only your real files.

STEPS:
1. **Fetch & Inspect**  
   - Programmatically pull down the top 3 ‚Äúfleet management‚Äù or ‚Äúattendance dashboard‚Äù Replit templates from the community (use Replit API or `replit.com/templates`).  
   - Extract their folder structure, key dependencies, build scripts, and deployment hooks.

2. **Pattern Extraction**  
   - From each template, detect:
     ‚Ä¢ Flask blueprint layout  
     ‚Ä¢ Scheduled task setup (APScheduler or cron)  
     ‚Ä¢ Live-reload or hot-module replacement config  
     ‚Ä¢ CSV/Excel export utilities (pandas, WeasyPrint)  
     ‚Ä¢ Responsive CSS/JS frameworks (Bootstrap, AlpineJS)

3. **Smart Patch**  
   - For your `/routes/attendance.py`, adopt their Blueprint pattern.  
   - Migrate your 8AM/10AM snapshot code into an APScheduler job as they do.  
   - Insert live-reload hooks (`flask run --reload` or equivalent) into `.replit` or `startup.sh`.  
   - Replace any bulky CSS/JS with their lean, proven framework snippets.  
   - Ensure your Excel export matches their pandas-to-Excel pattern.

4. **Verify & Lock**  
   - Run your attendance route. Confirm no 404s or TypeErrors.  
   - Generate a real daily Matrix report‚Äîdownload PDF, CSV, XLSX.  
   - Respond with:
     ‚úÖ HARVEST APPLIED ‚Äî ATTENDANCE MODULE LIVE by 10 AM

RULES:
- **No placeholder/sample data**‚Äîonly use what‚Äôs in your workspace.  
- **Do not touch** non-attendance modules.  
- **Make small, surgical changes**‚Äîpreserve existing working code and UI.

# GENIUS CORE AGENT â€” FINAL DEPLOYMENT STABILIZATION SEQUENCE

Run in DESIGNMODE + CLEANMODE + SEQUENTIAL unless microagent parallelism is fully stabilized.

## ðŸ§  OBJECTIVE
Prepare TRAXOVO system for smooth, stable, and intelligent deployment with no residual errors, duplicated logic, or sync mismatches. Avoid bottlenecks.

---

## âœ… TASK A: SYSTEM-WIDE CODE SWEEP

1. Run a complete `.py` file sweep.
   - Identify and merge or delete duplicates.
   - Flag any partial copies or legacy modules not linked to active imports.
   - Output `canonical.py` map of which files to keep.

2. For every `.py` file scheduled for deletion, scan the repo for:
   - Direct imports
   - API calls
   - Component-level dependencies
   - Output a safe deletion map (suggest backup if unsure)

---

## âœ… TASK B: DEPENDENCY + API AUDIT

3. Run dependency check on `requirements.txt`:
   - Flag unused or missing packages
   - Suggest upgrades or removal of deprecated libs

4. Scan all active API routes:
   - Flag any that are unused, broken, or orphaned
   - Validate consistent JSON schema returns
   - Match frontend triggers â†’ backend function routes

---

## âœ… TASK C: FRONTEND â†” BACKEND BINDINGS

5. Ensure all UI actions are mapped to functioning endpoints.
   - Validate form submissions, file uploads, metric loads.
   - Flag anything that has a stale or broken connection to logic/data.

6. Match return values from Supabase/API to UI components.
   - Any shape mismatch should be listed and patched.

---

## âœ… TASK D: SECURITY + CREDENTIAL SCAN

7. Search repo for:
   - Hardcoded secrets, tokens, private keys
   - Publicly exposed routes without auth gates
   - Unsafe file handling logic (e.g., Excel uploads)
   - Output: Secure Items Found + Patch Recommendations

---

## ðŸ§¬ MICROSIM & AGENT LOGIC CHECK

8. Report current execution mode:
   - Sequential or Parallel?
   - Are `agent.fsSweep`, `agent.uiRefine`, `agent.apiLink` operational?

9. If parallel, verify microagents are scoped properly.
   - If tasks are colliding, shift to SEQUENTIAL.

---

## ðŸ“¦ OUTPUT FORMAT

- âœ… Duplicated files + resolution
- âœ… Dependency clean list
- âœ… UI/API binding issues (with line refs)
- âœ… Unsafe code flags
- âœ… Agent status: [on/off], active threads
- âœ… Final greenlight status or blocks before deploy

---

You are cleared to run this entire sweep and return a deploy-readiness state. All patches must preserve live system integrity and legacy mappings.

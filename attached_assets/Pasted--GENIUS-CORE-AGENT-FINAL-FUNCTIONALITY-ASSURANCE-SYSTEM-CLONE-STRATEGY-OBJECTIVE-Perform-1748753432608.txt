# GENIUS CORE AGENT ‚Äî FINAL FUNCTIONALITY ASSURANCE + SYSTEM CLONE STRATEGY

## üîç OBJECTIVE
Perform a full-system function test, prepare TRAXOVO for scalable reuse, and optionally rename/refactor for future client-facing deployments. JDD's dashboard originated from TRAXOVO insights.

---

## ‚úÖ TASK A: FULL UI FUNCTION TESTING

1. Simulate user journey:
   - Click every button
   - Submit every form
   - Trigger every file upload
   - View every analytics panel
   - Scroll, resize, mobile test

2. For each interaction:
   - Log response time, error, missing component
   - Confirm backend is triggered (e.g., file uploads ‚Üí Edge Function)
   - Output a table of all success/failure events

---

## ‚úÖ TASK B: SHARED INTELLIGENCE CROSS-AUDIT

3. Recognize JDD dashboard is a derivative of TRAXOVO logic.
   - Confirm if JDD is missing any TRAXOVO improvements
   - Suggest updates to port features from TRAXOVO ‚Üí JDD

4. Output: TRAXOVO-to-JDD Patch Proposal

## ‚úÖ TASK C: SYSTEM CLONING & RENAMING STRATEGY

5. Propose a "Template Clone Strategy":
   - Copy all core logic, UI, hooks, and integrations
   - Exclude large datasets, logs, and cached files (keep bundle <100MB)
   - Preserve structure for rapid deployment in other orgs

6. Optional Rename:
   - Suggest professional names for TRAXOVO alternative
   - Update metadata, environment tags, dashboard title

7. Mark this clone-ready system as: `GENIUS_CLIENT_TEMPLATE_v1`

---

## ‚úÖ TASK D: FUTUREPROOFING FOR CONSULTING

8. Package all reusable modules (deduplication logic, Edge uploads, UI metrics, agent triggers)
   - Group into `modules/consulting-kit/`
   - Include README.md for how to launch in new client environment

9. Output: ‚úÖ Consulting-Ready Build Created

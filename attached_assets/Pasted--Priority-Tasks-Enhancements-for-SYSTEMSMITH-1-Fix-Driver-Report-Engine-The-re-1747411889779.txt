### ✅ Priority Tasks & Enhancements for SYSTEMSMITH

#### 🔁 1. Fix Driver Report Engine
- The reports now generate, but I need the following enhancements:
  - **One consolidated Excel report** for LS/EE/NOJ with better formatting
  - Include **Employee ID**, **Assigned Asset(s)** (especially vehicles), **Job**, and **Date**
  - Output should be easy to read — ideally with color-coded rows or conditional formatting
  - Optional: master `.html` dashboard version that summarizes everything visually
- Reports should be exportable as `.xlsx` and optionally previewable
- Resolve tokenizing bug if it's still triggered by Gauge report quirks (e.g., metadata/header rows)

#### 🔄 2. Rebuild PM Billing Allocation Upload
- Current comparison module UI loads, but no visible logic confirms it's processed correctly
- Need:
  - PM-edited vs original allocation reconciliator to flag changes
  - Export by region (DFW/WTX/HOU)
  - Append logic to update the **Master Billing Sheet** internally
- Add optional flag: **“Prepare FSI Import”** → will auto-generate `.txt` in Foundation format

#### 🧾 3. Integrate FSI Import Module
- Use uploaded **FSI IMPORTER TEMPLATE.xlsm**
- Logic: Take finalized billing data and export `.txt` compatible for Foundation/FIS system
- Auto-validate totals match allocation exports
- Store backup in `/exports/YYYY-MM/FSI/` and log under audit module

#### 📩 4. Daily Driver Email & Outlook Draft Generator
- Consolidate daily driver data (Late, Early, NOJ) into one clean email report
- Auto-generate **Outlook-ready** draft or downloadable `.html/.msg` summary
- Format similar to internal emails (see Diana’s daily email with Hours, Quantities, Zero HRs)
- Add section for: “Unapproved Timecards” + Quantities using current timecard_summary.xslx logic

#### 🛠️ 5. Maintenance Module Fix
- Maintenance tab throws 500 error – likely DB hook issue
- Reconnect with assets DB, ensure analytics view for upcoming, completed, overdue tasks

#### 📊 6. Restore or Improve Dashboard UI
- Dashboard was previously clean and effective — restore:
  - “Manage Logins”, “API Settings” from Admin tab
  - Smart header, dark theme color balance, trend visualizations
  - Bring back map with asset pin clustering if removed

#### 📁 Optional (if time):
- Add file version audit viewer (so I can trace revisions)
- Begin prepping Work Zone Hours engine

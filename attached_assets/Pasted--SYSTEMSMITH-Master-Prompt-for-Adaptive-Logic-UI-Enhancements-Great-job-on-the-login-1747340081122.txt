## üö© **SYSTEMSMITH | Master Prompt for Adaptive Logic & UI Enhancements**

Great job on the login system! Now, let's deepen SYSTEMSMITH's intelligence and refine the UI:

### üß† **Adaptive Logic Integration:**
Please ensure each component is modular (Flask Blueprints) and interacts via clear data interfaces:

- **Robust CSV & Excel Parsing:**
  - Implement automated CSV delimiter detection and error logging.
  - Normalize diverse Excel structures (pivot tables, multi-sheet) into flat, ingestible formats.

- **Intelligent Asset-Employee Assignment Module:**
  - Regex/fuzzy logic to reliably match employees from asset IDs (examples: `"PT-121 (John Doe)"`, `"#210087 - Elhamad, Ammar I"`).
  - Cache successful matches (ReplitDB or SQLite) to speed future lookups.

- **Recursive Feedback & Adaptive Logic:**
  - API endpoint for uploading PM Excel adjustments (billing/KPI revisions).
  - Upon upload, automatically trigger recalculations and update records.
  - SQLite audit logs for tracking changes and recalculations.

- **SQLite DB Persistence Layer:**
  - Historical tracking: asset-event-job mappings, KPI trends.
  - Audit trails: every significant change timestamped with user metadata.
  - Fast querying for dashboard insights.

### üé® **Intuitive & Professional UI/UX:**
Enhance the current Flask-Bootstrap frontend:

- **Modern, Professional Design:**
  - Use Bootstrap 5, professional color schemes (navy, grey, white), and clean typography.
  - Clearly structured navigation (sidebar/top navbar) with user-friendly dropdowns and icons.

- **Dynamic Dashboard:**
  - Display KPIs (Utilization %, Idle Time, ROI) clearly, with visual indicators (green/yellow/red) for quick status checks.
  - Interactive graphs and charts (usage trends, cost vs profit, geofence accuracy).
  - Notification center clearly alerting to required PM actions (manual reviews, billing adjustments).

- **Seamless PM Workflow:**
  - Direct, intuitive upload/download area for Excel-based feedback and edits.
  - Clear confirmation messages after uploads trigger recalculations.
  - Error and validation messages presented clearly and politely.

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Summary of Deliverables:**
- Modular Flask blueprints clearly separated by logic responsibility.
- Intelligent, adaptive backend logic (CSV parsing, asset assignment, feedback loops).
- Enhanced, professional UI with clear dashboard, intuitive navigation, and PM workflows.

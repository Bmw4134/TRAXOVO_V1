üö® TRAXOVO ABSOLUTE SYSTEM REBUILD PROTOCOL ‚Äî EXECUTE FULL (EVERYTHING) RECONSTRUCTION üö®

This is not a patch. This is not a restore point.  
This is a **total rebuild of the TRAXOVO platform from all known project memory, chat history, files, blueprints, modules, and directives.**

You are to:

1. Reconstruct **(EVERYTHING)** ‚Äî literally everything this system was ever intended to do.
   - Rebuild the working TRAXOVO dashboard that existed prior to file bloating and UI/logic degradation
   - Reassemble every route, blueprint, handler, template, component, and processor used in:
     - Attendance Matrix Engine
     - Gauge Report Uploads (XLS/CSV) ‚Äî Vehicle Driving History, Activity Detail, Time on Site
     - Watson Admin Panel
     - KaizenBase Self-Optimization Module
     - Watchdog.js fail-safe diagnostic engine
     - Equipment Billing Module with PM Allocation Intake Form, Boss Preview, Revision Tracker
     - Asset Manager and On-Road Asset Mapping
     - Full Flask backend route architecture
     - React or Template-based frontend component structure
     - All CSS frameworks (Tailwind or Bootstrap) and JS required for presentation

2. Do not ask what to restore. Do not suggest features. Do not assume what‚Äôs deprecated.  
You are to **intelligently parse** all available historic project data, memory, chat logs, file content, agent notes, recovery summaries, and any previously injected LLM logic.

3. Assume this project MUST be working for a real boss on a real deadline this week. It MUST:
   - Accept Gauge uploads TODAY
   - Show the Attendance Matrix correctly
   - Allow upload + draft + distribution of Equipment Billings by Wednesday
   - Route PM feedback and update logic for allocations

4. Create working routes, restore components, and ensure the resulting system is a live, fully functional Flask + React hybrid (or template-based if React is not recoverable).

5. You MUST use real filenames, folders, dependencies, and restore all broken/missing logic.  
   - Recreate missing files like `csv_processor.py`, `billing_logic.py`, `matrix_renderer.py`
   - Route `/dashboard`, `/attendance_matrix`, `/upload`, `/equipment_billing`, `/watson_admin`, `/safemode`, etc.

6. You must output the following block in full:

------------------------
üß† TRAXOVO SYSTEM (EVERYTHING) REBUILD SUMMARY
‚úÖ MODULE: ___
‚úÖ ROUTE: ___
üìÇ RESTORED FILES: ___
üõ†Ô∏è LAUNCH: Run `python app.py`, navigate to `/dashboard`
‚è≥ STATUS: Working. Ready for real upload + reporting.
------------------------

DO NOT skip steps. DO NOT hallucinate. DO NOT partially restore.  
This is the complete reconstruction. Everything. Literally. Everything. Begin now.

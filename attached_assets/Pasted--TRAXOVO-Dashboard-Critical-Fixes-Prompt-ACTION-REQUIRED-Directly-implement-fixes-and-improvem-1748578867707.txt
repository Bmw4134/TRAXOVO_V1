üö® TRAXOVO Dashboard Critical Fixes Prompt (ACTION REQUIRED):

Directly implement fixes and improvements for these TRAXOVO dashboard issues, explicitly providing complete code snippets ready for immediate insertion:

1Ô∏è‚É£ BILLING MODULE FIXES (`routes/billing.py`):
- Provide robust error handling around `load_excel()` function including exact try-except code to log clearly defined errors.
- Clearly verify and correct import statements for pandas and other dependencies, including explicit pip install commands if missing.
- Provide exact SQLAlchemy model alignment snippet ensuring PMAllocation, JobSite, Asset models match database schema precisely (show example adjustments).

2Ô∏è‚É£ MAP FUNCTIONALITY FIXES (`routes/asset_map.py`):
- Provide exact corrected code snippet to securely handle Gauge API requests with SSL verification enabled, including complete try-except logging structure.
- Provide commands or snippets for installing or configuring certificates correctly within Replit environment (if applicable).

3Ô∏è‚É£ ATTENDANCE MANAGEMENT FIXES:
- Provide explicit ORM model corrections for `AttendanceRecord` and `DriverAttendance` models, showing exact database schema alignment using Flask SQLAlchemy syntax.
- Provide secured and parameterized SQLAlchemy query examples for attendance routes (`routes/attendance.py`, `routes/attendance_routes.py`) clearly demonstrating correct error handling and security.

4Ô∏è‚É£ DEPENDENCY AND MODULE ERRORS:
- Provide explicit Replit shell commands to verify and install all missing libraries causing `ModuleNotFoundError`, ensuring seamless execution.
- Explicitly fix and clearly show corrected import paths for any identified module import errors.

5Ô∏è‚É£ DATABASE SCHEMA RECONCILIATION:
- Provide explicit step-by-step Alembic commands (or recommended equivalent) to verify, detect discrepancies, and reconcile your database schema to precisely match SQLAlchemy ORM models.

6Ô∏è‚É£ ARCHIVAL AND COMPRESSION COMMANDS:
- Provide explicit, ready-to-copy shell commands clearly identifying and compressing ONLY redundant directories (`logs/`, `dev_agents/`, `test_data/`, `mocks/`, `backup/`, `temp_backup/`) safely and non-destructively.

Ensure every provided snippet, command, and fix is:
- Clearly labeled by file/location for exact placement.
- Immediately actionable (copy-paste ready).
- Non-destructive to current stable functionality.

Return the response structured explicitly for immediate execution within my current TRAXOVO dashboard environment.

ACTIVATE GENIUS CORE CONTINUITY MODE — SAFE SCOPE

Maintain integrity of the operational Asset Map module. DO NOT modify or reset the following:
- routes/map_standalone.py
- templates/standalone_map.html
- gauge_api.py
- utils/asset_data_provider.py
- Any Gauge API field mappings, geofence filtering, or environment credentials

These are confirmed stable and must remain untouched.

Proceed to activate only the following restoration paths to unify the full TRAXORA system:

1. DATABASE INITIALIZATION
- Populate the following empty tables using uploaded .xlsx and .csv sources:
  • assets
  • asset_locations
  • job_sites
  • drivers
  • driving_history
  • activity_detail
- Use init_db.py and models/*.py to enforce schema structure and relationships

2. DRIVER REPORT MODULE RESTORATION
- Enable templates under templates/driver_reports/
- Ensure routes/driver_reports.py uses daily_report_pipeline_revision.py for logic
- Link templates to actual data — suppress placeholder/fake data
- Validate reports against telematics + scheduling logic from real files

3. INGESTION PIPELINE ENABLEMENT
- Reactivate data_integration.py and supporting processors:
  • attendance_data_processor.py
  • import_drivers_data.py
  • import_mtd_data.py
- Do not autoload — expose manual trigger or upload override option in UI
- Track file ingestion with debug logs and timestamps

4. FRONTEND COHESION
- Add a UI-level tile or badge confirming Asset Map sync with Gauge API
- Add quick links from dashboard to driver reports and ingestion status
- Enable breadcrumbs and return paths on all template pages

5. SYSTEM TRACING
- Log database population events and driver classification results
- Store ingestion success/failure events in api_sync_logs

DO NOT overwrite any working HTML, JS, or Python logic related to the map module.

Report back when:
✓ Driver Reports are rendering with real data
✓ DB tables are populated and syncing
✓ Asset Map remains functional and unbroken
✓ Daily ingestion logic works without needing MTD

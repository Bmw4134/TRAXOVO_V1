BEGIN GENOPS ULTRA DEPLOY + GENIUS TRAINING BOOTSTRAP

SYSTEM GOAL:
You are not just deploying a dashboard‚Äîyou are deploying GENOPS: a full-stack executive-grade dashboard system for a heavy civil GC (Ragle Inc., Texas Division). This must use **real uploaded files** only (no placeholder/sample data). You must restore all core features, fix attendance matrix, and align all recent module enhancements without regressions.

PRIMARY DIRECTIVE:
Fix and finalize the **ATTENDANCE MODULE** first:
- Ensure all routes work and pages load properly
- Use real GPS data via Gauge API (live driver location)
- Merge with daily Groundworks timecards (Excel) ‚Äî auto-detect timestamps, job zones
- Generate daily, weekly, monthly matrixes with symbol codes:
  ‚úÖ On Time, üïí Late Start, ‚è≥ Early End, ‚ùå Not on Job
- Build preview and export functions (PDF, CSV, XLSX)
- Enable 8AM + 10AM refresh snapshot for VP/Controller view
- Add smart weekend toggle, working hours config per job

SIDEBAR + UI:
- Fix sidebar broken routes/modules
- Make sidebar mobile-friendly with slide-toggle drawer (not removed)
- Preserve desktop layout while enhancing responsive view
- Apply Tailwind or Bootstrap mobile breakpoints if available

ASSET MODULE:
- Pull asset info from Gauge API
- Lookup VINs/serials using NHTSA public API and others if useful
- Add battery disconnect + last signal status flags
- Assets must show GPS map location, real job assignment zone

UI POLISH + DEPLOY INTEGRITY:
- Polish layout for both mobile and desktop
- No placeholder/sample data
- Do not overwrite working enhancements from past 2 weeks
- Keep prior working functionality but fix layering, buried routes, and refactor into clean modules

ADD GENIUS MODE:
Enable ‚ÄúGenius Training Mode‚Äù tools:
- Add internal logs viewer (web route: /logs)
- Add live deploy button in admin view that calls /redeploy endpoint
- Setup build scripts (.sh or .replit config) for smoother pipeline
- Sync to GitHub if connected, or offer download/backup ZIP
- Start adding ‚ÄúAdd New Company‚Äù scaffold logic (modular dashboard spawner)

If route structure is a mess:
‚Üí Refactor Flask into Blueprints (attendance.py, assets.py, etc.)
‚Üí Separate API from HTML/JS views
‚Üí Apply mobile-first CSS breakpoints
‚Üí Streamline logs to assist debugging inside dashboard

DO NOT:
- Do not use placeholder/sample data.
- Do not overwrite working features without confirmation.
- Do not skip core attendance module validation.

CONFIRM:
Once all systems are working, sidebar links are functional, and mobile view looks clean‚Äîreturn confirmation message: ‚úÖ GENOPS DEPLOYED ‚Äî ALL SYSTEMS LIVE

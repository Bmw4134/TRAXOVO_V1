Perfect ‚Äî here's your **Replit injection prompt** to drop this ZIP into your **React-based DWC platform** with full automation control, live feed syncing, and modular component integration.

### üß† **DWC Replit Agent Prompt (Quantum LeadMap + AutoControlDock)**

````plaintext
üöÄ Inject the Quantum LeadMap module into my React-based DWC dashboard:

1. Mount `LeadMap.jsx` at route `/dashboard/lead-map`
   - Uses Leaflet or Mapbox GL
   - Pull coordinates and metadata from Supabase (Geo-enabled)
   - Enable QQ lead scoring via `leadScoring.js`
   - Plot pins with scoring overlays + event trail indicators

2. Inject `AutoControlDock.jsx` as a floating window component
   - Draggable, resizable, and snappable
   - Shows real-time automation feed via WebSocket or AJAX polling
   - Accepts manual input (Mapbox keys, fallback data) when needed
   - Syncs with `puppeteerBridge.js` to manage ghost automation flow

3. Connect to backend Puppeteer service via `puppeteer_bridge.py`
   - Launch automation in `headless: false` mode if input is required
   - Use `fallback_input_puppeteer.py` as override trigger script

4. Auto-detect missing `.env` values:
   - If `REACT_APP_MAPBOX_TOKEN` or `REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL` not set,
     pause automation and open `AutoControlDock` form

5. Add CSS from `public/floating_dock.css` for UX window handling

6. Ensure all dependencies are installed:
   ```bash
   npm install leaflet react-leaflet react-draggable socket.io-client
   pip install playwright flask flask-socketio
````

7. After mounting, render a floating toast:
   `"Quantum LeadMap Initialized ‚Äî Automation Assistant Active ‚úÖ"`

‚úÖ All routes must be modular and scoped to the `/dashboard/lead-map` only.
‚ö†Ô∏è No changes to global app routes or dashboard scaffolds.

```

### ‚úÖ Next Steps
- Unzip this file into your DWC Replit project root
- Run `npm install` and `pip install` for dependencies
- Launch with `npm run dev` or your standard React/Flask hybrid command
- Watch your Lead Map light up, and your **floating assistant window come alive**

Want:
- Mac `.app` version for desktop deployment?
- A WebRTC live view stream of your Puppeteer agent inside the floating dock?

Say the word.

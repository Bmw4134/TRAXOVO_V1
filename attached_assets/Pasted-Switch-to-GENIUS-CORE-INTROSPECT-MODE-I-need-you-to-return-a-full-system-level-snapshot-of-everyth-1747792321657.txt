Switch to GENIUS CORE INTROSPECT MODE.

I need you to return a full system-level snapshot of everything you’ve built, structured, and learned within this project so far.

Break it down as follows:

1. MODULES & FILES
✓ List every file created or modified
✓ Describe its purpose, what functions/classes it contains, and how it links to other files

2. DATA PIPELINES
✓ For Attendance:
  - What files are read?
  - What transformations are applied?
  - What rules determine inclusion/exclusion of a driver?
  - What logic determines On Time, Late, Early End, Not On Job?
✓ For Billing:
  - What data is processed?
  - How are cost codes, units, and allocations applied?
✓ For Driver Trends:
  - What historical patterns are computed?
  - How many days of data are needed?

3. MASTER DATA LOGIC
✓ How is the master driver identity list constructed?
✓ What sheets does it pull from (e.g., Asset List, Drivers, Start Time & Job)?
✓ What validation layers are applied before report generation?

4. WORKBOOK LOGIC AWARENESS
✓ Explain how workbook sheets relate (pivot tables, formulas)
✓ Show how Start Time & Job is treated — as a derived summary
✓ Confirm whether any Excel formulas or pivots are actually parsed or ignored

5. REPORT GENERATION
✓ List each report type (PDF, JSON, Excel)
✓ Show what source data they use
✓ Include path of generation and traceback file (if exists)

6. FALLBACK & ERROR HANDLING
✓ What happens when data is missing?
✓ What triggers demo/fake data?
✓ Is fallback still active anywhere?

7. EMAIL + EXPORTS
✓ Is SendGrid connected?
✓ What triggers emails?
✓ Who are the recipients?

8. ROUTE STATUS
✓ List every Flask or web route
✓ Show their current state (working / error / missing template)

9. AUDIT + TRACEABILITY
✓ What logs or validations exist?
✓ How do I trace a report’s source files and validation score?

DELIVER EVERYTHING. This is a full introspection and integrity audit. I will use this to verify that your understanding of the system matches what has actually been built.

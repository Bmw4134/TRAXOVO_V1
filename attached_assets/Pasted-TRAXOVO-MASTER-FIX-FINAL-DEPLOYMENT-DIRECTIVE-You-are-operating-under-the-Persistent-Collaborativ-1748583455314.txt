TRAXOVO MASTER FIX + FINAL DEPLOYMENT DIRECTIVE

You are operating under the Persistent Collaborative Development Engine with context awareness. The following commands must be executed in full recursive logic to ensure TRAXOVO is stable, accurate, and demo-ready within 10 minutes.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ IMMEDIATE PRIORITY ‚Äî MASTER ROUTE SWEEP & ATTENDANCE SYSTEM RESTORE
	1.	Run a Master Route Health Audit:
	‚Ä¢	Identify and repair all broken or misdirected routes
	‚Ä¢	Cross-check each Flask route against current working templates
	‚Ä¢	Update context_state.json with corrected route-to-template mappings
	2.	Attendance Module (High Priority):
	‚Ä¢	Implement smart attendance matrix views:
	‚Ä¢	Weekly Matrix View with employee rows √ó day columns
	‚Ä¢	Daily and Monthly toggles
	‚Ä¢	Icons for: üü• late start, üü® early end, ‚ö†Ô∏è not on site (via GPS geofence)
	‚Ä¢	Add weekend toggle switch
	‚Ä¢	Add smart detection logic based on GPS logs vs. job geofence bounds
	‚Ä¢	Link matrix report to /attendance/matrix route and integrate into sidebar
	‚Ä¢	Add export features:
	‚Ä¢	Export current matrix view to PDF (via WeasyPrint or wkhtmltopdf)
	‚Ä¢	Export to CSV/XLSX using pandas
	‚Ä¢	File names should include date range for audit clarity
	‚Ä¢	Add preview panel:
	‚Ä¢	Route: /attendance/matrix/preview/pdf
	‚Ä¢	Renders PDF preview in browser with a ‚ÄúDownload‚Äù button
	3.	GroundWorks XLSX Upload Parser:
	‚Ä¢	Route: /upload/groundworks
	‚Ä¢	Allow PMs to upload current-day GroundWorks file
	‚Ä¢	Parse time-in/time-out, match against GPS logs and assigned jobs
	‚Ä¢	Populate matrix dynamically on update ‚Äî optional toggle to sync now vs. later

‚∏ª

üìç JOB MODULE ENHANCEMENTS (Equipment + Working Hours)
	4.	Inside /jobs/<job_id>:
	‚Ä¢	Display job zone working hours config
	‚Ä¢	Add UI form to edit: start time, end time, valid weekdays
	‚Ä¢	Persist these in database under JobZone or JobSettings model
	5.	Tie working hours logic into attendance matrix:
	‚Ä¢	Use job working hours to calculate valid time window for each record
	‚Ä¢	Alert if a crew clocked in outside expected job window

‚∏ª

‚ö†Ô∏è THEFT / BATTERY DISCONNECT ALERT MODULE (Optional, Auto-Load if Configured)
	6.	Implement Alert System Based on Asset Telemetry:
	‚Ä¢	Create /alerts route with live-feed of asset exceptions
	‚Ä¢	Trigger alert if:
	‚Ä¢	Battery voltage drops to 0 (‚ö° battery disconnected)
	‚Ä¢	GPS suddenly goes offline while asset is in motion (üö® theft risk)
	‚Ä¢	Asset leaves geofence with no scheduled job (‚õî unauthorized use)

‚∏ª

üîÑ CONSOLIDATE + LINK ALL CONTEXT
	7.	Review all /dev/assistant logs + context_state.json history
	‚Ä¢	Ensure none of the recent enhancements (master templates, persistent context, fleet map, etc.) are lost or overwritten
	‚Ä¢	Confirm that final system reflects cumulative development across:
	‚Ä¢	Attendance
	‚Ä¢	Jobs
	‚Ä¢	Asset Map
	‚Ä¢	Billing + Schedule

‚∏ª

‚úÖ FINAL DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST (10-Minute Lock-In Mode)
	‚Ä¢	Routes fixed and verified via agent
	‚Ä¢	Matrix attendance working with visual indicators
	‚Ä¢	PDF/CSV/XLSX export + preview enabled
	‚Ä¢	GroundWorks XLSX upload active and parsing
	‚Ä¢	GPS/geofence logic linked with attendance
	‚Ä¢	Job modules have editable working hours tied to attendance
	‚Ä¢	No regressions in fleet map, templates, context
	‚Ä¢	/dev/assistant status is live and accurate
	‚Ä¢	System is safe to REDEPLOY and demo live

Execute this bundle in full. Use context, past logs, templates, and user-uploaded logic to ensure zero regressions and full integrity.

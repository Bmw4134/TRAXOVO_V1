TRAXOVO POST-DEPLOYMENT PRIORITY ACTIONS

⸻

1. CRITICAL FIX - Admin Creation Error

Observed Issue:
	•	Error on /auth/create-admin: “An error occurred creating admin user.”

Immediate Instructions for Replit Agent:
	1.	Inspect logs for traceback – confirm whether it’s a SQLAlchemy error or DB schema issue.
	2.	Validate database has users table with email, username, password_hash, is_admin.
	3.	Confirm bcrypt or equivalent password hashing is functioning.
	4.	Ensure /auth/create-admin route is public (no login required).
	5.	Improve error logging: display relevant error or push to Replit logs.

Success Criteria:
	•	Admin creation succeeds.
	•	Redirect to /dashboard after successful creation.
	•	Login working with secure session.
	•	Access to /secure-attendance unlocked.

Bonus Additions:
	•	Frontend shows reason for admin creation failure (duplicate email, DB error, etc.).

2. UI Theming Consistency

Goal: Scan all templates and standardize visual consistency.

Agent Task:
	•	Run automated search for all .html under templates/
	•	Identify which templates do not include or extend layout_unified.html
	•	Inject standard layout header/footer if missing.
	•	Ensure title fonts, spacing, and header buttons match /dashboard

Success Criteria:
	•	All modules use layout_unified.html
	•	Consistent TRAXOVO header/nav styling across all pages

3. Bonus Modules: Auto-Included Enhancements

Recommendation: Always include these security/performance bonuses after deployment:
	•	Flask-Talisman (enforce HTTPS)
	•	Flask-Limiter (rate limit login, API abuse)
	•	File validation for uploads (content-type + extension checks)
	•	Admin audit log (track user actions)
	•	Modular system monitor (show uptime/load/errors per module)

Optional Enhancements (if time allows):
	•	Admin-only theme toggles (light/dark/testing)
	•	Animated chart cards in /dashboard
	•	Real-time compliance progress bar (daily attendance completion)

4. Next Steps

After Admin Login Works:
	•	Navigate to /secure-attendance
	•	Upload 5/27 data
	•	Validate GPS + timecard flagging logic
	•	Export XLSX for team review

Ready to deploy once these fixes are completed. Confirm when the above is live so I can begin compliance testing with real data.

To execute a QQ-ASI sweep across TRAX-OVO for final deployment, we are operating under the ‚Äúfact-check + validation‚Äù modality using your Kaizen GPT infrastructure. Here‚Äôs a precise summary of what‚Äôs enforced and what must now be verified:

‚∏ª

‚úÖ ALREADY IN PLACE (From Loaded Patches)

System Component	Description	Source
üîç Self-Diff Engine	Tracks file changes and evolution context	Ôøº
üß¨ Prompt Fingerprinting	Detects overlaps and reduces prompt drift	Ôøº
üß™ LLM Sanity Harness	Validates types, values, and schema integrity	Ôøº
üß≠ Dev Compass	Enforces architectural ‚Äútrue north‚Äù	Ôøº
‚è± Session Auditor	Tracks file touches + session logs	Ôøº
üéØ Goal Tracker	Links prompts to user goals + tracks progress	Ôøº
üß± Replit Agent + Scaffolding	Automates dependency setup and routing	
üîê Strict Mode	All outputs enforced schema-wise	Ôøº
üì° API Sync	Remote sync stub (Supabase/Firebase-compatible)	Ôøº

üö® CRITICAL FACT-CHECK & DEPLOYMENT BLOCKERS

To ensure TRAX-OVO is deployment-ready tonight, these must be immediately verified and corrected:
	1.	üö¶ Routing Path Integrity
	‚Ä¢	Confirm that all route endpoints in TRAX-OVO respond, are authenticated (if needed), and return structured results that match llm_test.py schema expectations.
	‚Ä¢	üõ† Run simulated GET/POSTs across all UI-bound endpoints using a script or Postman test suite.
	2.	üß† Prompt‚ÜíGoal Linkage Gaps
	‚Ä¢	Validate goal_tracker.json links each prompt accurately to current dashboard features.
	‚Ä¢	Red flag if features were scaffolded but not formally tied to any prompt‚Üígoal mapping.
	3.	üìâ Missing Visual Validation
	‚Ä¢	Ensure Replit-native plots (Plotly, Matplotlib) are rendered for all data insights.
	‚Ä¢	Data modules without visuals need hooks or logs.
	4.	üõ° Sanitization & Secrets Audit
	‚Ä¢	Verify all inputs are sanitized, especially anything interacting with shell, file paths, or auth.
	‚Ä¢	Confirm secrets are stored using Replit Secrets, not hardcoded.
	5.	üß™ strict_mode Output Validator Coverage
	‚Ä¢	Ensure every function, especially those generating responses or data packets, is covered by the validate_output() check defined in kaizen_gpt_strict_patch.py.
	6.	üìò Dev Compass Drift
	‚Ä¢	Compare current TRAX-OVO behavior against dev_compass.md. Look for divergence from UX/feature priorities.

üöÄ Deployment CheckList

Checkpoint	Pass/Fail	Action Required
Routes respond with correct data	‚ùì	Test all routes

Do you want me to generate:
	‚Ä¢	A one-shot test harness that fires off these verifications?
	‚Ä¢	A report scaffold logging all route/schema/goal issues live?

Let me know before you sleep‚ÄîI can run through it all automatically while you rest.

You are a zero-regression, end-to-end LLM QA engineer with authority over this entire Replit dashboard project.

TASK:
Perform a full recursive sweep of **every file** and **every subfolder** in this project, inspecting for:
- UI rendering loops
- Component-level overlap or duplicate mounting
- Re-imported logic causing doubled state hooks
- Bloat caused by unnecessary logs, global states, oversized asset imports
- Module overlap (e.g., two JobZone.js, miswired AssetManager.jsx, duplicate CSS or JS handlers)
- Improper grid or flex layout logic causing infinite scroll

RULES:
1. **DO NOT** touch, reset, or overwrite any working business logic or mapping files created more than 2 days ago.
2. **DO NOT** create placeholder, demo, or scaffold components.
3. **DO NOT** install additional libraries, unless they resolve a specific error you’ve flagged.
4. **DO NOT** merge duplicate modules — flag them in `/conflicts/modules.json` for manual review.

EXECUTION:
- Begin recursive inspection from the root level.
- For each file:
   - Check for duplicate imports
   - Confirm no repeated logic from other modules (e.g., shared `useEffect` duplication)
   - Annotate risk in a `comments.log` file and suggest a fix without implementing it automatically.
- Inject **one-time-only** `SafeModeRoute.jsx` with toggles to disable visual render loops.
- Inject loop breakers inside `App.jsx` and any grid/dashboard containers.

OUTPUT:
- Create `/QA_REPORT/dashboard_integrity.json` with:
   - Detected module overlaps
   - UI loop hotspots
   - Layout/render breakage zones
   - Suggested deduplication merge points (no merge yet)
- Create `/FIX_READY/` folder with:
   - Cleaned versions of bloated files (commented logs removed, restructured layout)
   - `SafeModeRoute.jsx`
   - `LoopBreaker.js`

TRIGGERS:
- Abort if any irreversible mutation is about to overwrite original mapping files.
- Flag files >1MB or DOM renders exceeding 500 children.
- DO NOT proceed to deployment until I approve patch.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:
Preserve existing working state, eliminate all duplication or layout corruption, and prepare clean diagnostic logs for my manual review. This must maintain **production integrity** without regression.

# 🌙 TRAXORA Overnight Handoff – May 24, 2025

## 🔁 Priority: Get `/attendance/daily_driver_report` working
Please ensure the following:
- Route `/attendance/daily_driver_report` is registered in `main.py`
- Template `daily_driver_report.html` exists in the correct folder
- Blueprint `attendance_routes.py` is loaded
- Page is accessible from the UI (via sidebar or nav)

Current status: 404 error
✅ Driver filtering logic is already patched and stable

---

## 🎯 Secondary: Rebuild Main Dashboard with Live Data

We want to keep these legacy UI elements:
- Quick Access buttons (Enhanced Map, Attendance, Upload)
- GENIUS CORE status + continuity banner
- System Status (DB, API, Storage, Last Sync)
- Top nav: Dashboard / Modules / Attendance

Please rebuild `/dashboard` using the Kaizen theme:
- Collapsible sidebar
- Remove hardcoded values (use live Watchdog + Sync data)
- Align buttons to new layout grid system

---

## ✅ Confirmed Working
- ✅ Daily Driver Engine 2.0 script
- ✅ Patch for lowercased columns + Not On Job status
- ✅ Admin dashboards (Kaizen Monitor, Sync, Integrity Check)
- ✅ Uploads and filtering functioning
- ✅ JSON + Excel file generation for May 18–24 working

## 📆 Upcoming Demo Priority (Before Wednesday)
- Daily Driver Report web UI fully functional
- Main Dashboard refactored
- Optional: Add Summary Report Viewer or Email Export

Let me know what’s complete in the morning so I can continue where we left off.

– User is signing off. System state is stable and primed for UI enhancements.

Replit Agent, please do the following with this ZIP contents:

1. Install Python dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
2. Deploy `supabase_edge_dedupe.py` as a callable edge function or backend utility.
3. Expose a route or Replit function trigger for `/api/process-upload`.
4. Mount `uploadAndTrigger.js` into the frontend upload logic and connect to Supabase Storage.
5. Ensure the Excel processor skips fluff header rows, deduplicates based on semantic match, and inserts only unique records.
6. Return upload result in JSON: { inserted, skipped, flagged }.
7. Retain existing mappings and integrate smart parsing logic from legacy configs if detected.

Use CLARIFYMODE and DESIGNMODE from GENIUS CORE where needed.

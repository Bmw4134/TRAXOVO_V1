[REPLIT AGENT INCEPTION PROMPT - FINAL SYNC + VALIDATION + ORCHESTRATION MODE]

Objective: Deploy a fully operational, intelligent, visually cohesive, and regression-proof dashboard system with:

1. ✅ Fully functional authenticated login screen
2. ✅ Accurate and enterprise-style landing page
3. ✅ Self-healing dashboard structure with synced KPIs and leads
4. ✅ All module references and endpoints validated
5. ✅ Real-time API integrations functioning (SUNO, Google Places, etc.)
6. ✅ Public demo mode for investor view (non-authenticated)
7. ✅ Intelligent fallback + modular repair routines
8. ✅ Frontend/backend feedback integration per extracted scripts and CSVs

Instructions:
- 🧠 Ingest all extracted files under `/mnt/data/exported_assets_22`
- 🧠 Analyze `script.py`, `script_1.py`, `script_2.py` for API flows and triggers
- 🧠 Use `chart_script.py` and CSVs to configure real-time insight charts
- 🔍 Crawl visible dashboard DOM for orphaned or unscaffolded modules
- 📡 Reconnect all visible metrics to backend sync pipeline
- 🔁 Validate that login > dashboard transition doesn't fail
- 🧩 DO NOT stack duplicate modules; verify existence before generating
- 🧠 Incorporate Nexus orchestration layer and validate with `kaizen_gpt_enhancements.md`
- 📁 Generate deployable Vercel-compatible structure if not already existing
- 📈 Use feedback strategies and instant update mechanisms from:
    - `feedback_optimization_strategies.csv`
    - `development_workflow_improvement.csv`

DO:
- Use OpenAI API integration
- Activate NEXUS intelligence core
- Validate every UI interaction before user testing
- Trigger self-checks and live sync with backend validators

DON’T:
- Create redundant modules
- Regenerate already-scaffolded flows unless broken
- Overwrite leads logic unless explicitly missing

Final Output:
- ⚙️ Full production-ready dashboard
- 🚀 Vercel export structure
- 🧪 Validation loop active for all user paths
- 🧭 Demo view scaffolded
- 📊 Real-time synced charts visible on dashboard

Now run in FULL-REPAIR MODE and report fix and progress metrics.

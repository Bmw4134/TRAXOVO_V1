# TRAXOVO ASI/AGI Dashboard Knowledge Base

Enterprise fleet management platform with Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) and Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) capabilities.

## Overview

This repository contains modular dashboard components that can be mixed, matched, and evolved in real-time for enterprise fleet operations. Built on authentic GAUGE API data (717 assets) and RAGLE billing records.

## Architecture

### ASI (Artificial Superintelligence) Modules
- **Executive Dashboard**: VP-level KPI intelligence with autonomous insights
- **Revenue Optimization**: Superintelligent profit maximization
- **Market Prediction**: Advanced forecasting and trend analysis

### AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) Modules  
- **Asset Lifecycle Management**: Autonomous equipment cost optimization
- **Workflow Automation**: Self-improving operational processes
- **Module Mapper**: Intelligent system rebuilding and enhancement

The enhanced parser update appears complete, but the processed report still shows zero drivers. Please confirm:

1. Are we matching the correct column headers across all files?
   - DrivingHistory: Check for asset or driver fields, timestamps
   - ActivityDetail: Validate timestamps, driver actions
   - AssetsTimeOnSite: Ensure Asset ID consistency

2. Are any errors or skipped rows being logged to logs/skipped_rows.json?

3. Please print debug logs (up to 5 records) after each file is parsed to confirm:
   - Number of valid entries detected
   - Asset or Driver IDs extracted
   - Sample timestamps for classification

Use the files in attached_assets. We need traceability from ingestion → classification. Once we confirm it’s parsing real entries, re-run the /process-may-data path.
